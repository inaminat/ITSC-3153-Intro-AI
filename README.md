8 Queens

Instructions:     
Write a program that places 8 queens on an 8x8 board where none of the queens are in conflict with each other.  You are to implement the solution by using the Hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts.

Problem Overview & Algorithm Description:   
The 8-Queens problem requires that 8 queens be placed on a board with 8 rows and columns so that no queen occupies the same row, column or diagonal as another queen.  To solve this problem using the Hill-Climbing with random restart algorithm, we must first generate a random starting state which places a queen in a random row of each column.  From there, we first check to see if the state is a goal state (no queens are in conflict). If not, we evaluate all of the possible neighbor states by moving each columnâ€™s queen through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for each of those states.  When all of the neighbor states have been generated, we check to see if any states were generated that have a lower heuristic value than the current state.  If a better state was not found, then we have reached the local minima and must perform a random restart.  If a better (lower heuristic) state was found, then that state becomes the current state and the above process is repeated on that state. 


Path Finder

Instructions: 
Write a program that implements the A* algorithm to find a path from any two given nodes.  You may use any of the following languages: C++, C#, Java, ActionScript.


Problem Overview & Algorithm Description:
In a fully-observable environment where there are both pathable and blocked nodes, an agent must find a good path from their starting node to the goal node.  The agent must use the A* algorithm to determine its path.  For this program, you must use the Manhattan method for calculating the heuristic.
